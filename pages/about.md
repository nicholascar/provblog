## About
Our science and business is becoming very complex: we generate vast amounts of data, work on it with multiple partners, link it to all sort of other data, use a vast array of formats for it, compute with it on complex machines and store it all over the world. Despite this, transparency for our data and processes is highly sought after in order to instill trust in it. People want to know how we got the results we did.

Transparency is required for reproducibility and reproducibility is the soul of science. If we can't maintain reproducibility, our data, whether for research, policy or business decisions, isn't scientific.

I believe that we are actually in a bit of a crisis right now. There are quite a few scientific papers lamenting the irreproducibility of much of today's data *published in high-profile scientific journals* [1]!
 
 So this blog really is all about provenance. Provenance can be defined as the information about data, things that happen to data and the agents that cause things to happen. Serious, systematic studies of provenance are needed to understand what information should be presented, and how it should be presented, in order for data and process transparency. On the pages and posts of this site you'll find some serious studies of provenance.
